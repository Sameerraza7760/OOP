// what is oop

// oop is an structor of programing that what kind of structure you prefered for doing programing like in object format

// what is object in OOp concept

// ans is actally a collection of properties and method

// parts of OOP

// Object Literal
//  - Constructor
// - classes
// - Instances (new ,this )
// -protoTypes

// Four pillers Of Oops
//Abstraction
//Encapsulation 
//Inheritence
//PolymorPhism

// what is constructor
// a special method in class for make the special object where this object contain the nesseay data
// and autometically call when the new instance of class create

// why we used constuctor

// Initialization: The constructor is used to initialize the properties of the class when a new instance is created.
// Object Setup: It helps in setting up the necessary state of the object based on parameters passed when the object is instantiated.
// Code Reusability: The constructor allows us to create multiple instances of a class with different initial values without writing repetitive code.

// what is classes
// a piece of collection where method and properties are defiend

// /Why Use Classes?
// Organize code: Classes provide a clear structure for creating objects with similar behavior and properties.
// Encapsulate data and behavior: It keeps related functions (methods) and variables (properties) together.
// const user = {
//   username: "sameer",
//   age: 20,

//   getUserName() {
//     console.log(this);
//   },
// };

// user.age = 90;

// console.log(user.getUserName());

// now for exampale we need a user2

// const user2 = {
//   username: "sameer",
//   age: 20,

//   getUserName() {
//     console.log(this);
//   },
// };

// user.age = 90;

// console.log(user.getUserName());

// thats is the code repeatation for same code thats wrong thats why we need constructor
class User {
  constructor(username, age) {
    this.username = username;
    this.age = age;
  }

  getUserName() {
    return this;
  }
}

const newUser1 = new User("sameer", 20);
// console.log(newUser.getUserName());

// in this if we need the second user so we just need to write only this line
const newUser2 = new User("usman", 21);

// thats why we used Construction of reuibility

// now

// the Promise also constructor

// const newPromise = new Promise();
// const newDate = new Date();

// in this the new keyword also doing and shows this is constructor method and new is used for create the multiple  instances
// of same object

// now we make the function thats works like constructor

function user(username, isLoggedin, loginCount) {
  (this.username = username),
    (this.isLoggedin = isLoggedin),
    (this.loginCount = loginCount);
  this.greeting = function () {
    console.log(`Hello ${this.username}`);
  };
  return this;
}

// const userOne = user("sameer", false, 90);
// const userTwo = user("usman", true, 20);

console.log(userOne);

// crypto: [Getter],
// username: 'usman',
// isLoggedin: true,
// loginCount: 20
// }

// due to used this function instead of used constructor the information of user overaide change

// so if we used with new

const userOne = new user("sameer", false, 90);
const userTwo = new user("usman", true, 20);

// what is new keyword

// the new keyword is just like to work like if we call with new
// first step to create the empty object
// second step to make a construuctor method where the argument go and atteched woth the empty object bu using this

// Why Use new?
// Encapsulation: It allows you to create multiple instances with their own properties.
// Clarity: Using new makes it clear that you are creating a new object instance.
// Correct this Binding: Ensures that this refers to the new instance instead of the global object.
// Conclusion
// Using new with a constructor function is essential for proper object-oriented programming in JavaScript. It ensures that instances are created correctly and that properties are assigned to the right object.

// Encapsulation bundles and restricts access to data and methods.
// Abstraction hides complex implementation and exposes simpler interfaces.
// Inheritance allows classes to share and extend behavior.
// Polymorphism enables treating different types through a shared interface.

// Encapsulation

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this._age = age; // Private-like variable (convention with _)
  }

  getAge() {
    return this._age; // Encapsulated access to _age
  }

  setAge(newAge) {
    if (newAge > 0) {
      this._age = newAge;
    }
  }
}

const person = new Person("John", 25);
console.log(person.getAge()); // 25
person.setAge(30);
console.log(person.getAge()); // 30

// Encapsulation
// Encapsulation in JavaScript is about keeping data safe within
//  an object or class by restricting direct access and providing methods
// (getters and setters) to interact with that data.



//////////////////////////////////////




// Abstraction
class Car {
  constructor(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }

  // Public method (abstracted detail)
  startCar() {
    this._igniteEngine(); // Abstracted engine ignition
    console.log("Car is starting...");
  }

  // Private method (hidden complexity)
  _igniteEngine() {
    console.log("Igniting engine...");
  }
}

const car = new Car("Tesla", "Model X");
car.startCar();
// Output:
// Igniting engine...
// Car is starting...

// . Abstraction
// Abstraction hides the complexity and only exposes the essential
// features of an object, allowing the user to interact
// with a simplified interface.



///////////////////////////////////////////////
// Inheritence

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Buddy barks.

// 3. Inheritance
// Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.





/////////////////////////////////////////////////////






// 4. Polymorphism
// Polymorphism allows objects of different types
// to be treated as objects of a common super type, often by overriding methods.

class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks.");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Cat meows.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks.");
  }
}

const animals = [new Animal(), new Cat(), new Dog()];
animals.forEach((animal) => animal.speak());
// Output:
// Animal speaks.
// Cat meows.
// Dog barks.



// Polymorphism lets us treat objects from different classes as
//  if they are from the same class. This means methods can work differently
//   depending on what type of object is being used, making our code more flexible and reusable.

// polymorphysim 
 

// Step 1: Parent Class (Vehicle) 

class Vehicle {
  start() {
    console.log("The vehicle is starting.");
  }

  stop() {
    console.log("The vehicle is stopping.");
  }
}


// Step 2: Child Classes that extend Vehicle 


// Now, we want to create specific types of vehicles: a car and a motorcycle.

// Car will behave differently when it starts.
// Motorcycle will behave differently when it starts.
// We’ll use extends to inherit the start() and stop() methods from Vehicle but 
// customize them for each child class. 


class Car extends Vehicle {
  start() {
    console.log("The car is starting with a smooth engine sound.");
  }
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
  start() {
    console.log("The motorcycle is starting with a loud rev.");
  }
}


// Step 3: Using the Classes
// Now, you can create instances of Car and Motorcycle and call the start() method. Notice that
//  even though both classes extend Vehicle, they each have their own version of start().



const myCar = new Car();
const myMotorcycle = new Motorcycle();

myCar.start();         // Output: "The car is starting with a smooth engine sound."
myMotorcycle.start();   // Output: "The motorcycle is starting with a loud rev."

myCar.stop();           // Output: "The vehicle is stopping."
myMotorcycle.stop();    // Output: "The vehicle is stopping.





// What is Happening?
// The Vehicle class defines common behavior (like start() and stop()) that all vehicles share.
// The Car and Motorcycle classes extend Vehicle, which means they inherit its methods (like stop()),
//  but they can override the start() method to provide their own unique behavior.
// We don't need to write the stop() method again in Car or Motorcycle because it was inherited from 
// Vehicle.





// Without extends:
// If you don’t use extends, you’ll have to rewrite the same methods (start(), stop())
//  in every class, which is repetitive and harder to maintain. For example:

js
class Car {
  start() {
    console.log("The car is starting with a smooth engine sound.");
  }

  stop() {
    console.log("The vehicle is stopping.");
  }
}

class Motorcycle {
  start() {
    console.log("The motorcycle is starting with a loud rev.");
  }

  stop() {
    console.log("The vehicle is stopping.");
  }
}
